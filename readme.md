# Interactive Programming in Nim  [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/gregwedow/interactive-nim.png)](https://circleci.com/gh/gregwedow/interactive-nim)

Inspired by [Interactive Programming in C](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/12/23/), this is a quick proof-of-concept to provide the same functionality in Nim.

Just clone the repo and run 

    make && cd bin && ./main

Then you can make changes to `hello.nim`, run `make` again, and see the changes magically appear in the running app.
